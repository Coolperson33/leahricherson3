  <h1>Week 3 (part 1) - Making a heat transfer vinyl print for a T-shirt.</h1>
    <div class="box">
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        For our introduction to CNC, my assignment was to vinyl cut something and I immediately had an idea. One of my favorite music artists, Mitski, released a merch line that consited of a hat that said "Listening to Mitski."(pictured below) Instead of paying $40 for that hat, I decided i could just make a shirt myself.
      </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        My design was just made using the Cricut software and using text. after importing it and cutting, I had to painstakingly peel away all the extra vinyl that i didnt need. Eventually, i had my design and I heat pressed it onto a black T-shirt.

    <h1>Week 3 (part 2) - Designing a press fit cardboard project.</h1>
    <div class="box">
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            For my Press fit cardboard project I tried my best to make a Formula 1 car, and it was way more than I bargained for.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            Unfortunately, Most of my design history was deleted after trying to delete the reference images I used, but I based my design on the Aryton Senna era of F1, using these <a href=week3inspo.html>images for inspiration</a>
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
            After sketching out some basic pieces i gave up on making it in 3d and hoped that everything would just work out. So I started sketching out the body and the front wing.

        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
          Now in theory I should have a laser cut Formula 1 car. If I were to go back and do this again, I would plan it much better instead of trying to use an image of an f1 car as a projection, and I would actually set parameters like I was warned a Crillion times to do. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">This is one of the most stressfull projects I've done. It's not the first car I've designed in fusion, but my lack of organization on this projectmade it a nightmare towards the end of the project. After laser cutting and trying to assemble my car, I realized there were multiple holes I forgot to cut.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
          To get the wheels to look the way I want without glue, I went to home depot and pciked up a 1/4 inch Wood dowel do be the axle.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        And here's the finished project :)

        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        (p.s. Dont' try to sketch directly on an image in Fusion, once you delete the image it will break the entire sketch.)
