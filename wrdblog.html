            <h1>Corporatocracy: How Corporations Keep Control</h1>

    <img src="https://images.wsj.net/im-45648618?width=700&height=467" alt="Corporate leaders influencing politics">

    <p>On January 20, 2025, Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States. Behind him sat three of the wealthiest men in America: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg. That image alone speaks volumes. Corporate power has infiltrated politics so deeply that billionaires often have a louder voice than voters. The U.S. is teetering on the edge of corporatocracy—a system where corporate interests outweigh democratic governance.</p>

    <h2>Buying Political Influence</h2>

    <img src="https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/673.jpeg" alt="Lobbying and political contributions">

    <p>The 2010 <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2008/08-205" target="_blank">Citizens United v. FEC</a> decision allowed unlimited corporate spending in elections, effectively letting billionaires buy candidates. The reason? Profit. Corporations want policies that protect their wealth. Studies show that lobbying for tax breaks yields a staggering <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1375082" target="_blank">22,000% return on investment</a>. In 2022 alone, the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2023/01/business-interests-spent-3-5-billion-on-federal-political-contributions-during-the-2022-cycle/" target="_blank">fossil fuel industry spent $243 million</a> on lobbying—investing in policy that benefits them, not the public.</p>

    <h2>Keeping the Public Distracted</h2>

    <img src="https://insidesources.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/AP_16215763271544-1024x669.jpg" alt="Media manipulation and public distraction">

    <p>Corporations don’t just buy influence; they shape public discourse. Noam Chomsky warned that the best way to control people is to keep debate confined within a narrow spectrum while making it seem lively. Enter culture wars. Instead of uniting against corporate greed, the public is caught in endless battles over identity politics. Meanwhile, corporations quietly fund both sides—between 2020 and 2023, companies that condemned anti-LGBTQ+ laws still <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2023/06/companies-that-publicly-condemned-legislation-targeting-lgbtq-community-send-political-contributions-to-state-lawmakers-who-advanced-anti-lgbtq-bills/" target="_blank">donated over $2.4 million</a> to the politicians pushing those very laws.</p>

    <h2>The Real Cost of Corporate Control</h2>

    <img src="https://www.bankers-anonymous.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/inequality.jpg" alt="Worker exploitation and economic disparity">

    <p>While the ultra-rich amass wealth, workers struggle. From 1979 to 2019, median wages rose just <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation/" target="_blank">15.1%</a>, while the top 5% saw a 63.2% increase. When I worked at McDonald’s for $7.50 an hour, I saw coworkers working 100-hour weeks just to survive. One lost everything when his apartment burned down—he had no renter’s insurance and never returned to work. This isn’t just bad luck; it’s systemic exploitation.</p>

    <h2>How We Fight Back</h2>

    <img src="https://ssir.org/images/blog/James-Ozden-Funding-Protest-Movements-592x395.jpg" alt="Activism and political reform movements">

    <p>The good news? Change is possible. Here’s how we push back:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ban corporate donations</strong> like France does to prevent elections from being bought.</li>
        <li><strong>Publicly fund elections</strong> to remove billionaire influence.</li>
        <li><strong>Overturn Citizens United</strong> to reinstate campaign finance limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Strengthen labor rights</strong> to make unionizing easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Break up media monopolies</strong> to encourage independent journalism.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If we don’t act, corporate control will only tighten its grip. But history proves that when people demand change, they can get it. As <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1964/king/biographical/" target="_blank">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> said, <em>“Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.”</em> It’s time to speak up.</p>
