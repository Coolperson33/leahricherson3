            <h2>Rhetorical</h2>
            <p>
                I wanted to connect with people who might already have heard about corporate influence but didn’t really see how deep it goes. So, I started with a clear image of Trump with big CEOs like Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg. This helped me grab attention right away and show that big money really does affect our government. I kept the language simple so it felt real and relatable.
                
                </p><h2>Material</h2><p>
                I mixed up different types of content to make my point clear. I used that strong opening image, real numbers, and examples that people can see in everyday life; like how workers struggle with low wages or how media is controlled. I hoped these pieces would click with readers, letting them see the problem from different angles. Some parts worked better than others, but overall, I think using both facts and visuals really helped get my message across.
                
                </p><h2>Methodological</h2><p>
                My plan was pretty straightforward: show the problem first, explain how it affects us, and then suggest some ways to fix it. I built the essay in a step-by-step way so anyone could follow along, even if they didn’t know much about politics or economics. This helped me keep the argument clear and organized.
                
            </p><h2>Technological</h2><p>
                I had a few tools at my disposal: online databases for the latest numbers, digital libraries for research, and word processors with citation helpers. These made it easier for me to find up-to-date info and keep everything organized without too much hassle. Using these tools meant I could spend more time thinking about what to say rather than worrying about where to find the data.
                
            </p><h2>Overall Impact</h2><p>
                All these choices worked together to shape an argument that’s easy to understand and connects with people. I kept it simple, used clear examples, and organized my thoughts in a way that made sense from start to finish. In the end, this approach helped me build an argument that not only explained the issues clearly but also felt like a conversation with the reader.
